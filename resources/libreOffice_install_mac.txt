First check whether you have LibreOffice installed on
your system. By default, the installer installs the 
LibreOffice binaries in a folder named similar to 
/path/to/Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/.

If you don’t have LibreOffice installed on your system,
then you need to install GhostScript by following the 
instructions below that can be found in the user manual 
(https://goo.gl/4wfQSJ). Look for the section named
“Installing LibreOffice”.

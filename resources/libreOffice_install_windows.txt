First check whether you have LibreOffice installed on
your system. By default, the installer installs the 
LibreOffice binaries in a folder named similar to 
C:\Program Files (x86)\LibreOffice 5\program\.

If you don’t have LibreOffice installed on your system,
then you need to install GhostScript by following the 
instructions below that can be found in the user manual 
(https://goo.gl/4wfQSJ). Look for the section named
“Installing LibreOffice”.

You can check if you already have GhostScript installed by 
searching for executables namely gswin32.exe or gswin64.exe. 
If one of the following files exists in your system 
(for example C:\Program Files\gs\gs9.20\bin\gswin32.exe), 
you will need to install GhostScript by following in the
instruction manual (https://goo.gl/4wfQSJ). Look for the 
section named “Installing GhostScript”.

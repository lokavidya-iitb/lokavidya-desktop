You can check if you already have GhostScript installed by 
running the following command : 

which gs

If the above command returns a path which ends with gs 
(such as /usr/local/bin/gs), then you already have GhostScript 
installed and you do not need to go through the installation
procedure. If however running the following command does not
return anything, then you need to install GhostScript by 
following the instructions below that can be found in the
user manual (https://goo.gl/4wfQSJ). Look for the section 
named “Installing GhostScript”.
